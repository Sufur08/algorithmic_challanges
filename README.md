typo: *Challenges

I've never done a Readme before, I'll try following the template

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Other npm scripts

build
```sh
npm run build
```
move kotlin files into the website directory
(is called automatically for build and dev)
```sh
npm run move-kotlin
```

## To Develop Kotlin

I hope you can easily set this up using the Gradle files in kotlin-solutions
I don't know any general command line commands, I do it with the IDE.
